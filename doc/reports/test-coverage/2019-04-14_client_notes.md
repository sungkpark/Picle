Notes on the 2019-04-14 jacoco screenshot for the client part:
Both in the 'picle' and 'picle.view' parts, there is only 'view' related code, which is
not tested. All the other code in the client has a 100% branch coverage, which means our
overall branch coverage is 100% for the client and 96% for the server part.
