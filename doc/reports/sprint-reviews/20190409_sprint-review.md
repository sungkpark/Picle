# Sprint Review

## What everyone has been working on

- Andreas: Finished facelift of the UI. I still need to add a UI implementation for achievements. Finished animations and popups. Also, I added my individual feedback to the report. 
- Alp: Changed the api and controllers to fit specifications we discussed in last meeting. (Last week we discussed changing the server response to 200 OK with an empty array if no activities are found instead of 404 Not Found) Also I started working on the presentation and I added my individual feedback to the report.
- Jordy: Did research on score calculations for the last two activities. Both were implemented and tested. Also, implemented achievement controller but tests still need fine tuning which makes it work in progress. Besides that, increased test coverage for newly added methods from last week that were not tested yet.
- Omar: Did the individual feedback and process chapter for the report.
- Sung: Did the individual feedback for the report.
- Martijn: Did first and last chapter of the report. Setup division of tasks for the report. Spend time on getting password hashing on Windows but no progress yet. Also completed the weekly tasks.
- Just: Helped Jordy out with the achievement controller. I did the individual feedback for the report and started working on the presentation with Alp.
