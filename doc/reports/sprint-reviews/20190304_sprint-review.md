# Sprint Review Week 4

## What has everyone been working on

Andreas: Working on the GUI. Working on the wireframe; since the coding stage did not start he notes he did not encounter any real issues.

Alp: Working on research for testing, reading on mock testing and integration testing, trying to figure out which to use where, and how. Helped during the week with the formulation of the database model. Had some health problems that set back the research.

Jordy: Missed the unofficial server team meeting, has been working to understand how to implement testing on Spring.

Omar: Worked on client design with Andreas, has shifted his focus to client code. Other courses got in the way, but the point was to get them out of the way for the following weeks where client code will actually be written. Just will help with catching up about and writing client side code.

Sung: Helped design the database schema. Watched tutorials to link HTTP requests to the database (using DAO). It is still on a separate branch. Martijn notes parts of the branch could be cherry-picked because the branch is old. Martijn suggests Sung move to a more recent branch where the dependencies are up-to-date. Sung agrees.

Martijn: Read up on MariaDB and SQL and Java. Wrote sample code to create the schema and initializing the DB. Had issues with crashing tests, but they seem to be fixed. Wrote a proposal for the structure of the API, which Just notes he has one of too. Agenda template

Just: Working on Continious Integration pipeline. Now it works on the master branch. Has been working on the specs of the REST API.
