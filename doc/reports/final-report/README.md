Final report

As a final deliverable to have to hand in a report. The maximum amount of pages is 8
(excluding front page, Table of Contents, appendices, etc.). It is obligatory to deliver
a PDF version of your report; other file formats will not be graded. Make sure that the
report mentions your names and student numbers and group number. Spend some time on
spell-checking your work, make sure figures/tables have captions and are being referred
to in your text (explicit references like "see Figure X" are better than relative
descriptions like "see the image below").

What should be in the report?

Several things you should cover in the report;

    * Product:
        What design decisions have you made? (technological choices, architectural choices)
    * Process:
        How did the project go? (processwise)
    * Reflection:
        What can be improved? (reflection on process, product and course)
    * Individual feedback:
        Each member reflects on their own contributions towards the project (min. 200 words per member)
        What were your stronger/weaker points (refer back to your personal development plan and how you tried to improve) Are there any problems in the process/team that your did not expect? How did you handle this?
    * Value Sensitive Design
        Some more details about this will be added later

Hand in the report on Brightspace. The hand-in time on Brightspace is considered as the
official time you handed in your report. Please mind the deadline is April 11th at
