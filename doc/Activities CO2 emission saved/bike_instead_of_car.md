CO2 emission saved for taking the bike instead of a car
==================

This one was really easy since the United States Environmental Protection Agency, an official government agency simply gives the answer for an average passenger vehicle.
the source states that an average vehicle emits about 404 grams of CO2 per mile which translates to about 0,251 kg CO2 per km driven.

So the formula is 0,251 * km
