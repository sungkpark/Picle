CO2 emission saved for installing solar panels
==================
The article in the documentation gives clear numbers about the amounts of electricity produced by different types of generation and the amount of CO2 they produce.
This gives us the numbers:
41% is generated by coal which emits 950 grams per kWh.
22% is generated by gas which emits 350 grams per kWh.
16% is generated by hydropower which emits 0 grams per kWh.
11% is generated by nuclear power which emits 6 grams per kWh.
4% is generated by oil which emits 280 grams per kWh.
6% is generated by renewables which emits 0 grams per kWh.

This means that for every kWh of electricity, an avarage of (0,41*950)+(0,22*350)+(0,16*0)+(0,11*6)+(0,4*280)+(0,6*0)= 579,16 grams of CO2 is emitted.


## Final result
Since solar panels don't emit CO2 by generation electricity the amount of emission saved is 579,16 grams per kWh so the formula is x*579,16.
