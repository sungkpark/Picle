CO2 emission saved for using public transport
==================
Since there was no source that either gave an average for the emission of all public transport combined or the amount of kilometers traveled per kind 
of transport I've used the article in the documentation as source. Multiple sources that I looked into used the same numbers as this one so the data seemed reliable.
The source states that the average numbers for emission per transport type are:
car: 0,96 pounds per mile which translates to 270,58 grams per kilometer.
bus: 0,64 pounds per mile which translates to 180,38 grams per kilometer.
heavy rail: 0,22 pounds per mile which translates to 62,01 grams per kilometer.
light rail: 0,36 pounds per mile which translates to 101,47 grams per kilometer.
commuter rail: 0,33 pounds per mile which translates to 93,01 grams per kilometer.
van Pool: 0,22 pounds per mile which translates to  62,01 grams per kilometer.

Since I couldn't find any information about the amount of kilometers traveled per type of transport the best option was to just take the average
amount of emission for the above public transport types.
This makes the average amount of emission by public transport 85,38 grams of CO2 per kilometer traveled.
## Final result
Since the car emits about 270,58 grams per kilometer public transport will save about 185,2 grams of CO2 per kilometer traveled.
So the formula will be x*185,2
