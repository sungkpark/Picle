CO2 emission saved for eating a vegetarian meal
==================

Since we're only using one parameter (servings) for calculation the amount of CO2 saved. The formula will simply be servings times a constant. This constant will have to be an average amount of meat for all meals, all sorts of meat and ways of producing it. For this I've used multiple sources per part to find an average to calculating the constant.

## Amount of meat per meal
This part depends on whether you're eating breakfast/lunch or dinner. For breakfast/lunch I found that health guidelines(like the United States Department of Agriculture) suggest about 90 grams per sandwich while other sites suggest about 50 grams. Restaurants usually  serve around 170 grams and most people are inbetween the suggested and restaurant quantities, which is around 120 grams. For breakfast/lunch our average will them be 107,5 grams per sandwich.

For dinner it was expected that the quantities would higher. These ranged from 225 grams to 340 grams if the meat was the main part of the meal so on average 228,5 and about 140 grams if the meat was a side part. This gives us the average of 211,5 grams per serving.

Since breakfast and lunch happen twice a day we get a weighted average of 142 grams of meat per serving.


## Amount of emission for different kinds of meat
For this I decided to look into the percentages of comsumption for different kinds of meat. The 3 most consumed types are beef and buffalo (21,5%), pigmeat (35,6%) and poultry (34,5%).

For pigmeat the numbers were around 4,8 to 5 kg of CO2-eq (CO2-equivalents) per kg of meat produced and one source gave 12,1 which also calculated post-production emission (processing, transport, and cooking the meat at home). So taking the average of this gives us 8,5 kg of CO2-eq/kg.

For poultry the numbers were around 3,3 to 3,5 kg of CO2-eq/kg and the source that also calculates post-production emission gave a result of 6,9 kg of CO2-eq/kg. So taking the average of this gives us 5,15 kg of CO2-eq/kg.

For beef and buffalo we mostly get number ranging from 13,3 to 18,2 kg of CO2-eq/kg for cattle that's also held for milk. If the animals are only held for meat the numbers are aroung 67,6 kg of CO2-eq/kg. On average this means beef produces about 41,675 kg of CO2-eq/kg. The reason this result is so high is because of the amounts of methane cows produce which is a very potent greenhouse gas.

Keeping in mind the percentages of meat consumed this all gives us a weighted average of 15,02 kg of CO2-eq/kg.


## Final result
So with an average of 0,142 kg of meat per meal and 15,02 kg of CO2-eq/kg, our constant will be 2,13 kg of CO2-eq/serving.
